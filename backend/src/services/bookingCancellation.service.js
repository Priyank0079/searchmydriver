 *   ──────                                     ───────────
 *   searching                                 0  (no driver mobilised yet)
 *   driver_assigned / awaiting_payment /
 *   en_route (driver heading to pickup)       flat ₹ `flatFeeAfterAssignment`
 *   arrived / started (driver at pickup +)    `arrivedFeeType` decides:
 *                                               'flat'       → ₹ `arrivedFeeAmount`
 *                                               'percentage' → `arrivedFeeAmount`% of paid
 *
 * Whatever the customer is charged is then split between the driver
 * who was mobilised and the platform per
 * `cancellation.driverSharePercent`:
 *
 *   driverShare  = feeCharged × driverSharePercent / 100   → driver wallet
 *   companyShare = feeCharged − driverShare                → platform revenue
 *
 * All knobs live on `ServicePricing.cancellation` and are tunable from
 * the admin pricing editor.
 *
 * Driver penalty is a flat ₹ amount (`driverCancellationPenalty`) and
 * is debited from `driver.wallet.balance` when a driver cancels.
